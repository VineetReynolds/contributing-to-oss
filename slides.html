<section class="topic source"><h2>Why should you contribute to OSS ?</h2><p>You get to work :</p>
<ul><li>in the real world</li><li>on projects that matter</li><li>building an independently verifiable resume</li><li>and learn from really Smart People<sup>TM</sup></li></ul>
<details><details open=""><summary>Notes</summary><p>Read them out aloud ;-)</p></details></details></section>
<section class="topic source"><h2>Operate in the real world</h2><ul class="incremental"><li>You get to work in a <em>team</em></li><li>And ship <em>deliverables</em> to <em>users</em></li><li>Using good <em>tools</em> while employing good <em>practices</em><ul><li><strong>SCM</strong> - Git, SVN, Hg</li><li><strong>Build</strong> - Make, Maven, Gradle, Rake</li><li><strong>CI</strong> - Jenkins, Go, Travis, Teamcity</li><li><strong>Issue management</strong> - Bugzilla, JIRA, Mantis, Trac, Redmine</li><li><strong>Review contributions</strong> - Gerrit, GitHub, Bitbucket</li><li><strong>User documentation</strong> - Asciidoc, Docbook, Publican</li></ul></li></ul>
<details><details open=""><summary>Notes</summary><ul><li>Working individually does not expose you to the challenges faced in real world projects.</li><li>It results in a lot of self-discovery with little or no reinforcement.</li><li>You may never converse with users about their problems and the features they need.</li><li>You may never work in a collaborative manner with other developers.</li><li>So no one reviews your code constructively, or builds on top of your code to offer more features.</li><li>You may also avoid using tools and practices that teams in the real world use, putting at a disadvanatage when you continue to work otherwise.</li><li>SCM allows multiple developers to work on the same code base without using manual backup techniques (copy of project, copy2 of project etc. etc.) :D</li><li>Build tools allow you to build your project in an automated manner. How many of you have several page manuals describing how to download and compile your projects? We automate these in the real world.</li><li>CI server extend your build scripts to perform builds at regular intervals. Companies like Google and Amazon use CI to allow them to publish deployments at dizzying rate. In a duration of 10 minutes, a deployment would have occured somewhere in the company. How quickly can you deploy your project?</li><li>Do you use text files or excel sheets to track issues? Well, no one does that in the real world, unless they&#8217;re poorly informed.</li><li>What about code submissions from others? Do you review them at all? And do you track review comments for posterity to track reasons for change?</li><li>And have you ever considered publishing documentation. Be it library API guides for developers, or user guides for end-users?</li><li>You get use all of these in well-run open source projects, saving you time because you do not have to independently discover this yourself.</li></ul></details></details></section>
