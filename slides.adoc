*Objectives* +
Learn how contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) helps you, and how to contribute.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* This is a talk focussed on illuminatng aspects of open source projects, to an audience not composed of active contributors.
* It is to help interested individuals get started with contributing to open source.
* You'll eventually learn how contribute to GlusterFS later on in the talk, but the underlying principles are applicable to any project.
====

[.topic.source]
== Why should you contribute to OSS?

* OSS development == Real world development
* Work on projects that matter
* Build an independently verifiable resume
* Work with and learn from Really Smart People^TM^

[.topic.source]
== Real world development

[.incremental]
* Collaborative, _team_-based work
* Produce _deliverables_ for end-users
* Develop good _practices_ on using good _tools_:
** *SCM* - Git, SVN, Hg
** *Build* - make, Maven, Gradle, Rake
** *CI* - Jenkins, Go, Travis, Teamcity
** *Issue management* - Bugzilla, JIRA, Mantis, Trac, Redmine
** *Review contributions* - Gerrit, GitHub, Bitbucket
** *User documentation* - Asciidoc, Docbook, Publican

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Working individually does not expose you to the challenges faced in real world projects.
* It results in a lot of self-discovery with little or no reinforcement.
* You may never converse with users about their problems and the features they need.
* You may never work in a collaborative manner with other developers.
* So no one reviews your code constructively, or builds on top of your code to offer more features.
* You may also avoid using tools and practices that teams in the real world use, putting at a disadvanatage when you continue to work otherwise.
* SCM allows multiple developers to work on the same code base without using manual backup techniques (copy of project, copy2 of project etc. etc.) :D
* Build tools allow you to build your project in an automated manner. How many of you have several page manuals describing how to download and compile your projects? We automate these in the real world.
* CI server extend your build scripts to perform builds at regular intervals. Companies like Google and Amazon use CI to allow them to publish deployments at dizzying rate. In a duration of 10 minutes, a deployment would have occured somewhere in the company. How quickly can you deploy your project?
* Do you use text files or excel sheets to track issues? Well, no one does that in the real world, unless they're poorly informed.
* What about code submissions from others? Do you review them at all? And do you track review comments for posterity to track reasons for change?
* And have you ever considered publishing documentation. Be it library API guides for developers, or user guides for end-users?
* You get use all of these in well-run open source projects, saving you time because you do not have to independently discover this yourself.

[.topic.source]
== Work on projects that matter

Good open source projects:

* Do not exist for vanity
* Target a particular _problem_ or set of related problems
* Provide solutions for _businesses_ and _individuals_

They're integral to today's computing infrastructure.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* What happens when a business has a problem that requires a solution in software?
* Buy a COTS solution. Or get some to write it.
* COTS can be expensive. Starups generally dont like to fork out money for mundae stuff like OSes, databases, application servers, frameworks and libraries.
* There's no significant advantage to be gained in writing these from scratch either.
* So, re-use software built by others that happen to do a good job for your business.
* Working on a OSS project that solves a business need is no different from working on a similar proprietary solution.
====

[.topic.source]
== Work on projects that matter

* Many open source projects are sponsored by _foundations_ and large _companies_.
* Contributions associate you with their _work_ and _culture_.
* Contributions also _signal_ your knowledge about the _problem_ and its _solutions_.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* When a company goes about hiring someone for a particular role, they like to choose the person most knowledgeable in their domain. Quite obvious isn't it?
* When they use an OSS project, contributors stand to be the first to benefit, since they're most qualified.

== Some stats on the Linux Kernel
[subtle]#From the Annual Linux Development Report 2013#

[.incremental]
* Nearly _10,000_ developers from more than _1,000 companies_
* Contributions from _1,100 developers_ from _225 companies_ in 2012
* with growing numbers from _mobile_ and _embedded industries_.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Need proof of companies investing in open source? Look no further.
* Work done by contributors here find their way into the mainstream.
* Servers in datacenters, laptops, workstations and Android devices all benefit from these contributions.

== Some stats on the Linux Kernel
[subtle]#Top 10 organizations sponsoring development, from the Annual Linux Development Report 2013#

[.incremental.scatter.nolist]
* _Red Hat_
* _Intel_
* _Texas Instruments_
* _Linaro_
* _SUSE_
* _IBM_
* _Samsung_
* _Google_
* _Vision Engraving Systems Consultants_
* _Wolfson Microelectronics_

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* And these are not done by small-timers.
* The companies that happen to employ people to contribute to Linux have a vested stake in ensuring the success of their products and services.
* Some want to ensure that their software runs on all Linux distributions, others want Linux to run on their hardware.

[.topic.source]
== Build an independently verifiable resume

Contributions are *independently verifiable* and *undisputable* facts.

Why does it matter?

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Speaking of career development, OSS contributions lend to a trustworthy resume.
* Why should hiring managers trust OSS contributors more?
====

[.topic.source]
== Build an independently verifiable resume

Independently Verifiable

* The _burden of proof_ is not always on you.
* Contributions are _public_: they can be examined and verified by others.
* Contributions can be _verified_ in release notes, mailing list archives, bug trackers, commit logs, and more.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Hiring managers are no longer reliant on word-of-mouth references from previous employers. They can look up contributions at their own discretion, not requiring the services of a gatekeeper.
* Hiring managers can now verify the same data that they independently accessed.
====

[.topic.source]
== Build an independently verifiable resume

Undisputable

* Projects guarantee all accredidation is accurate.
* An accepted contribution has added value to the project.
* Your code speaks for itself.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* All activity on projects is archived for posterity and left untouched.
* While you may not get references from project leads and committers, it is not impossible.

"... a real-world portfolio of work gives you an edge when applying for jobs. Contributing to an open source project provides you with that real-world portfolio ..."
-- Leslie Hawthorn

[.topic.source]
== An example

[.middle]
image::stackoverflow-resume.png[]

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Career portals now allow you to post open source projects that you've contributed to.
* Needless to say, it makes sense to post those that have had an impact.
* Be prepared to justify the importance of these projects to hiring managers who may not understand the community using them ;-)
====

[.topic.source]
== Work with and learn from Really Smart People^TM^

* Smart people tend to work with other smart people.
* An OSS project with smart people draws and fosters others.
* Many of them will be glad to help you learn. Take them up on it.
* Very high quality of discussion. No bike-shedding.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* If there's one thing about smart people, it is that they spend time on working on 
* They try not to suffer the consequences of Parkinson's law of triviality.
* So, they try not to discuss how to color the bike shed, and instead debate on how to construct a nuclear reactor.
====

[.topic.source]
== Work with and learn from really Smart People^TM^

Learning takes many forms:

* Understanding and fixing bugs.
* Performing code reviews or having your code reviewed.
* Deliberation over ideas.
* Designing and implementing new features.

If you are _engaged in the project_, you will be _learning_.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Working with smart people does not people that you are casually employed with them.
* You need to ensure that ideas, features and bug fixes, are reviewed by them.
* Understand their way of doing things. They are very rational beings and often have reasons to do things in a particular manner.
* Doing this over a course of time increases your engagement with the project.
* Engaging work increases cognitive function. This is a physiological behavior associated with dopamine. Working on stuff you like sometimes actually makes you smarter.
====

[.topic.source]
== Getting started with OSS

* _Choose a project_ to contribute to.
** Preferably one that you already use.
* _Become very familiar_ with it.
** Get involved on mailing lists, IRC, etc.
** Discover problem areas. Use the issue tracker.
** Learn about the processes. Some projects require contributions in only one form.
* _Discuss_ on resolving issues and adding features.
* _Submit_ a patch.

[.topic.source]
== Getting started with OSS

* Be _courteous_.
* _Communicate_ well. Be accurate with technical and project-specific jargon.
* Learn the _political_ waters. Every project has them.
* Remember that you will make _mistakes_. Learn from them!

[.topic.source]
== A sustained contribution model

* Be _persistent_. Continued contributions build respect.
* Become a committer. You can do anything now!
** ...within reason. :)
* Become very _knowledgeable_ in an subject area. Create demand for you.
* Be open to new _opportunities_:
** _Presenting_ at conferences
** _Reviewing_ books about the project, or even _authoring_ them.
** _Supporting_ related projects that build on yours.
** _Consulting_ for companies part/full-time.

[.topic.source]
== Reflect, recalibrate

image:ohloh-summary.png[]

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Sustained contributions would see your credibility rise in the community.
* Do not be place emphasis on the number of commits and other 'gameable' figures.
* Contributions to projects should be measured by "impact" through bug fixes affecting a large populace instead of micro-commits with no tangible value.
====

[.topic.source]
== Reflect, recalibrate

image:ohloh-timeline.png[]

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* The contributions started nearly two years ago. There is a gap due to a consulting engagement that arose directly out of OSS contributions.
* Book deals and offers to review books came in rather rapidly (with a year of contributing to Arquillian).
* Do not get discouraged by projects that are not enlisted. There's several missing ones in this graph.
* And again don't fret over numbers. The decrease is a result of moving into a 'healthier, more sustainable' lifestyle to avoid burnout.
