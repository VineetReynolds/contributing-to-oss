`Objectives` +
Learn how contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) helps you and how to contribute.

[.topic.source]
== Why should you contribute to OSS?

* OSS development == Real world development
* Work on projects that matter
* Develop an independently verifiable resume
* Work with and learn from Really Smart People^TM^

[.topic.source]
== Real world development

[.incremental]
* Collaborative, team-based work
* Produce *deliverables* for end-users
* Develop good practices and learn good tools:
** *SCM* - Git, SVN, Hg
** *Build* - make, Maven, Gradle
** *CI* - Jenkins, Go, Travis, Teamcity
** *Issue management* - Bugzilla, JIRA, Mantis, Trac, Redmine
** *Review contributions* - Gerrit, GitHub, Bitbucket
** *User documentation* - Asciidoc, Docbook, Publican

[.topic.source]
== Work on projects that matter

Good open source projects:

* Do not exist for vanity
* Target a particular problem or set of related problems
* Provide solutions for businesses and individuals

They're integral to today's computing infrastructure.

[.topic.source]
== Work on projects that matter

* Many open source projects are sponsored by foundations and large companies.
* Contributions associate you with their work and culture.
* Contributions also signal your knowledge about the problem and its solutions.

[.topic.source]
== Develop an independently verifiable resume

Contributions are *independently verifiable* and *undisputable* facts.

Why does it matter?

[.topic.source]
== Develop an independently verifiable resume

Independently Verifiable

* The *burden of proof* is not always on you.
* Contributions are public: they can be examined and verified by others.
* Contributions can be verified in release notes, mailing list archives, bug trackers, commit logs, and more.

[.topic.source]
== Develop an independently verifiable resume

Undisputable

* Projects guarantee all accredidation is accurate.
* An accepted contribution has added value to the project.
* Your code speaks for itself.

"... a real-world portfolio of work gives you an edge when applying for jobs. Contributing to an open source project provides you with that real-world portfolio ..."
-- Leslie Hawthorn

[.topic.source]
== Work with and learn from Really Smart People^TM^

* Smart people tend to work with other smart people.
* An OSS project with smart people draws and fosters others.
* Many of them will be glad to help you learn. Take them up on it.

[.topic.source]
== Work with and learn from really Smart People^TM^

Learning takes many forms:

* Understanding and fixing bugs.
* Performing code reviews or having your code reviewed.
* Designing and implementing new features.

If you are *engaged in the project*, you will be learning.

[.topic.source]
== Getting started with OSS

* Choose a project to contribute to.
** Preferably one that you already use.
* Get very familiar with it.
** Get involved on mailing lists, IRC, etc.
** Discover problem areas. Use the issue tracker.
** Learn about the processes. Some projects require contributions in only one form.
* Discuss on resolving issues and adding features.
* Submit a patch.

[.topic.source]
== Getting started with OSS

* Be courteous.
* Communicate well. Be accurate with technical and project-specific jargon.
* Learn the political waters. Every project has them.
* Remember that you will make mistakes. Learn from them!

[.topic.source]
== A sustained contribution model

* Keep at it. Continued contributions build respect.
* Become a committer. You can do anything now!
** ...within reason. :)
* Become very knowledgeable in a subject area. Create demand for you.
* Be open to new opportunities:
** Presenting at conferences
** Reviewing books about the project, or even authoring them yourself.
** Supporting related projects that build on yours.
** Consulting for companies part/full-time.

The Gluster Community

== !

"To create the world's largest and most dynamic community for open software-defined storage"
-- The Gluster Community Goal


[.topic.source]
== A bit of history

* Starts as an attempt to build supercomputers using commodity hardware
* Storage becomes a bigger challenge and focus shifts to GlusterFS
* GlusterFS starts getting noticed and people start using it

[.topic.source]
== A bit of history

* Better management arrives and adoption of GlusterFS increases
* Red Hat becomes the primary sponsor for the Gluster community
* Grows into a community for open source, software-defined storage


[.topic.source]
== So what is GlusterFS?

GlusterFS is

* an open source, distributed, scale-out filesystem
* fully posix compliant
* user friendly :)
* easily extensible

...and much more.
