`Objective` +
To discover how contributing to OSS helps you, and to learn how to contribute.

[.topic.source]
== Why should you contribute to OSS ?

* Operate in the real world
* Work on projects that matter
* Develop an independently verifiable resume
* Work with and learn from really Smart People^TM^

[.topic.source]
== Operate in the real world

[.incremental]
* You get to work in a team
* And ship *deliverables* to users
* Using good tools while employing good practices
** *SCM* - Git, SVN, Hg
** *Build* - Make, Maven, Gradle
** *CI* - Jenkins, Go, Travis, Teamcity
** *Issue management* - Bugzilla, JIRA, Mantis, Trac, Redmine
** *Review contributions* - Gerrit, GitHub, Bitbucket
** *User documentation* - Asciidoc, Docbook, Publican

[.topic.source]
== Work on projects that matter

* Good open source projects do not exist for vanity.
* They solve a particular problem for businesses ...
* In a really good way.

They're integral to today's computing infrastructure.

[.topic.source]
== Work on projects that matter

* There are several such projects.
* Sponsored by foundations and large companies.

== Develop an independently verifiable resume

Independently Verifiable? Why does it matter?

Facts are *independently verifiable*. They're *undisputed*.

[.topic.source]
== Develop an independently verifiable resume

* Independently?
** The *burden of proof* is not always on you.
** The author of contributions can be discovered by others.

[.topic.source]
== Develop an independently verifiable resume

* Verifiable?
** Your contributions are public. They can be examined and verified by others.
** Contributions are reflected in release notes, list of contributors, mailing list archives, bug trackers, commit logs among others.

"... a real-world portfolio of work gives you an edge when applying for jobs. Contributing to an open source project provides you with that real-world portfolio ..."
-- Leslie Hawthorn

[.topic.source]
== Work with and learn from really Smart People^TM^

* Smart people tend to work with other smarter people.
* An OSS project with smart people begets others.
* The best thing you could do for yourself is to learn from them.

[.topic.source]
== Work with and learn from really Smart People^TM^

Learning happens when:

* You discuss new features or bug fixes.
* You perform code reviews or have your code reviewed.
* *You are engaged in the project*.

[.topic.source]
== Tips on getting started with OSS

* Choose a project to contribute to.
** Preferably one that you already use.
* Get very familiar with it.
** Get involved on mailing lists and IRC.
** Discover problem areas. Use the issue tracker.
** Discuss on resolving issues and adding features.
** Learn about the processes. Some projects require contributions in only one form.
** Submit a patch.

[.topic.source]
== Tips on getting started with OSS

* Be courteous.
* Communicate well.
* Learn the political waters. Every project has them.
* Learn from your mistakes. And correct them.

[.topic.source]
== A sustained contribution model

* Keep at it.
* Become a committer. You can do anything now^well not really^
* Become the most knowledgeable in an subject area.
* Be open to opportunities.
** Present at conferences
** Review books about the project, or even author them yourself.
** Support related projects that build on yours.
** Consult for companies part/full-time.
