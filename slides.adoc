*Agenda* +
Learn how contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) helps you, and how to contribute.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* This is a talk focussed on illuminatng aspects of open source projects, to an audience not composed of active contributors.
* It is to help interested individuals and companies get started with contributing to open source.
====

[.topic.source]
== Why should you contribute to OSS?

* OSS development == Real world development
* Work on projects that matter to businesses
* Develop deep technical expertise in technology stacks
* Work with and learn from Really Smart People^TM^

[.topic.source]
== Real world development

[.incremental]
* Collaborative, _team_-based work
* Produce _deliverables_ for _end-users_
* Develop good _practices_ on using good _tools_

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Working individually does not expose you to the challenges faced in real world projects.
* It results in a lot of self-discovery with little or no reinforcement.
* You may never converse with users about their problems and the features they need.
* You may never work in a collaborative manner with other developers.
* So no one reviews your code constructively, or builds on top of your code to offer more features.
* You may also avoid using tools and practices that teams in the real world use, putting at a disadvanatage when you continue to work otherwise.
* SCM allows multiple developers to work on the same code base without using manual backup techniques (copy of project, copy2 of project etc. etc.) :D
* Build tools allow you to build your project in an automated manner. How many of you have several page manuals describing how to download and compile your projects? We automate these in the real world.
* CI server extend your build scripts to perform builds at regular intervals. Companies like Google and Amazon use CI to allow them to publish deployments at dizzying rate. In a duration of 10 minutes, a deployment would have occured somewhere in the company. How quickly can you deploy your project?
* Do you use text files or excel sheets to track issues? Well, no one does that in the real world, unless they're poorly informed.
* What about code submissions from others? Do you review them at all? And do you track review comments for posterity to track reasons for change?
* And have you ever considered publishing documentation. Be it library API guides for developers, or user guides for end-users?
* You get use all of these in well-run open source projects, saving you time because you do not have to independently discover this yourself.

== Work on projects that matter

Good open source projects:

* Do not exist for vanity
* Target a particular _problem_ or set of related problems
* Provide solutions for _businesses_ and _individuals_

They're integral to today's computing infrastructure.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* What happens when a business has a problem that requires a solution in software?
* Buy a COTS solution. Or get some to write it.
* COTS can be expensive. Starups generally dont like to fork out money for mundae stuff like OSes, databases, application servers, frameworks and libraries.
* There's no significant advantage to be gained in writing these from scratch either.
* So, re-use software built by others that happen to do a good job for your business.
* Working on a OSS project that solves a business need is no different from working on a similar proprietary solution. Their objectives are the same.

[.topic.source]
== Work on projects that matter

* Many open source projects are _sponsored_ by _foundations_ and large _companies_.
* Contributions associate you with their _work_ and _culture_.
* Contributions also _signal_ your knowledge about the _domain_, the _problems_ and their _solutions_.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Open source has a viable business model because of the concept of professional open-source.
* Companies pay individuals to build capabilities or maintain open-source software that they use.
* When a company goes about hiring someone for a particular role or a company for building services, they like to choose the person most knowledgeable in their domain. Quite obvious isn't it?
* When they use an OSS project, contributors stand to be the first to benefit, since they're most qualified.
====

[.topic.source]
== What do we infer?

[.incremental]
* For businesses, there is _little value_ in writing systems in a _closed room_.
* There is an _opportunity cost_ associated with re-inventing the wheel.
* Such costs are not isolated. Think of operating systems, databases, messaging queues, application servers, ERP suites, CMSs, CRMs, ...


[.topic.source]
== Work with and learn from Really Smart People^TM^

* Smart people tend to _work with other smart people_.
* An OSS project with smart people draws and fosters others.
* Many of them will be glad to help you learn. Take them up on it.
* _Very high quality of discussion_. No bike-shedding.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* If there's one thing about smart people, it is that they spend time on working on non-trivial and complex stuff.
* They try not to suffer the consequences of Parkinson's law of triviality.
* So, they try not to discuss how to color the bike shed, and instead debate on how to construct a nuclear reactor.

== Work with and learn from really Smart People^TM^

Learning takes many forms:

* _Understanding_ and _fixing bugs_.
* Performing _code reviews_ or having your code reviewed.
* _Deliberation_ over ideas.
* _Designing_ and _implementing_ new features.

If you are _engaged in the project_, you will be _learning_.

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Working with smart people does not mean that you are casually employed with them. You need to engage with them everyday if possible.
* You need to ensure that ideas, features and bug fixes, are reviewed by them.
* Understand their way of doing things. They are very rational beings and often have reasons to do things in a particular manner.
* Doing this over a course of time increases your engagement with the project.
* Engaging work increases cognitive function. This is a physiological behavior associated with dopamine. Working on stuff you like sometimes actually makes you smarter.

How do businesses gain?

* Gain _access_ to smart people, their _experience and expertise_.
* Attain some _degree of certainty_ over advances in technology, aka obtain _a crystal ball_.


[.topic.source]
== Getting started with OSS

* _Choose a project_ to contribute to.
** Preferably one that you already use.
* _Become very familiar_ with it.
** Get involved on mailing lists, IRC, etc.
** Discover problem areas. Use the issue tracker.
** Learn about the processes. Some projects require contributions in only one form.
* _Discuss_ on resolving issues and adding features.
* _Submit_ a patch.

[.topic.source]
== Getting started with OSS

* Be _courteous_.
* _Communicate_ well. Be accurate with technical and project-specific jargon.
* Learn the _political_ waters. Every project has them.
* Remember that you will make _mistakes_. Learn from them!

[.topic.source]
== A sustained contribution model

* Be _persistent_. Continued contributions build credibility.
* Become a committer. You can do anything now !
** ...within reason :)
* Become very _knowledgeable_ in an subject area. Create demand for you.
* Be open to new _opportunities_:
** _Presenting_ at conferences
** _Reviewing_ books about the project, or even _authoring_ them.
** _Supporting_ related projects that build on yours.
** _Consulting_ for companies on projects requiring OSS expertise.

From user to committer...

"A few years ago, I decided to write a General Ledger system, in Java EE."
-- Yours truly


[.topic.source]
== The rationale behind contributing to Arquillian

* "I needed an equivalent of Jakarta Cactus for running _real_ tests, but something _nicer_."
* "Spring JUnit runner _does not fit_ my needs."
* "Arquillian is good, _but lacks support_ for WLS."
* "I _need this now_! I cannot wait for a benefactor to write this. It can't be that hard."
* "I better have some _control over the roadmap_ of the WebLogic adapter."

[.topic.source]
== And just how hard was this?

* _Learning_ Arquillian _as a user_: ~ 1 weeks.
* _Working on patches_ to _understand_ the codebase : ~ 6 weeks.
* _Contributing_ the WLS adapter: ~ 1 week.

[.topic.source]
== Cultural changes to expect

* _IRC_ is/was used pre-dominantly. _E-mail_ == slow.
* _Traditional power structures_ may be non-existent.
* Knowing the _right buttons to push_ is very important.
* Better to do your homework - have a _checklist_ at hand.
